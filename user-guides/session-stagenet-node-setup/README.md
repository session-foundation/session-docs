# üß™ Session Stagenet Node Setup

## Running a stagenet Session Node

You can run the stagenet Session Node software on any device running a supported operating system, but for the purposes of this guide, we'll assume you will be setting up a stagenet Session Node on a remote Ubuntu or Debian server. If you're new to Linux or running servers in general, this is the most straightforward approach. If you're more experienced and would prefer to run your stagenet Session Node on a different operating system, you'll need to modify the syntax of some commands to suit your system of choice.

#### **Running a stagenet Session Node: Requirements**

These are the current basic requirements for running a stagenet Session Node.  Note that these are generally much less than required for a mainnet node!

<table><thead><tr><th width="242">Spec</th><th>Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Latest stagenet Session Node software</td><td>Latest stagenet Session Node <code>.deb</code> packages (installed via the steps below) or latest <code>dev</code> branch build from source.</td></tr><tr><td>Server operating system</td><td>Ubuntu 20.04+ (latest LTS recommended) or Debian 11+ (latest stable recommended)</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>2GB or more</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>2GB</td></tr><tr><td>Connectivity</td><td>100Mb or faster</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Stagenet Session Nodes in a nutshell

* A stagenet Session Node starts as a full node on the Oxen stagenet blockchain.
* The full node becomes a stagenet Session Node when the owner locks the required amount of SESH (see below) and submits a registration transaction.
* Once accepted by the network, the stagenet Session Node starts performing node operations and becomes eligible to earn rewards in the form of test SESH.

**Stagenet Session Node functionality**

Stagenet Session Nodes:

* Monitor the Arbitrum Sepolia test network for new registrations and departures.
* Provide signatures required to withdraw rewards via Arbitrum
* Monitor other stagenet Session Nodes and vote on their performance
* Produce new blocks for the network via [Pulse PoS](https://docs.oxen.io/oxen-docs/about-the-oxen-blockchain/pulse-pos-on-oxen)
* Receive, store, and forward encrypted Session messages (not active currently)\*
* Route Lokinet traffic (not active currently)\*
* Are called into quorums that give them authority over Blink transactions (not active currently)\*

_\*As of July 16, 2024, Stagenet Session Nodes will only run the oxend-stagenet program, and do not currently run the Storage Server or Lokinet programs. As these programs are integrated into future iterations of stagenet and testnet Session Nodes, the functionality and requirements of nodes may change accordingly._

## Stagenet Session Node set-up for new users

### **Step 1: Obtaining a server**

Choosing where to set up your stagenet Session Node is the first and most critical decision you will face in setting up and running your node. There are a number of factors to consider. Because you will be locking up test SESH as part of operating your stagenet Session Node, you will want to ensure, at a minimum, that your server meets the technical requirements given above.

Your aim is to provide a stable, reliable server with good network connectivity, so that data can be efficiently routed to and from your node. An underpowered or poorly connected node will have a poor response time and add latency to the network for all users whose traffic passes through it, resulting in a less than optimal experience.

It is possible to run a stagenet Session Node alongside an existing (mainnet) Oxen Service Node without interfering with the mainnet Node.  Note that this will modestly increase the VPS requirements and should only be done if the mainnet Node has excess resources.

If your server goes down while staked, your stagenet Session Node could be [deregistered from the network](https://docs.oxen.io/oxen-docs/using-the-oxen-blockchain/oxen-service-node-guides/service-node-deregistration) and your test SESH locked for 30 days (without receiving rewards).

The simplest and cheapest way to host a server such as a stagenet Session Node is to lease a Virtual Private Server (VPS). There are literally hundreds of options when it comes to VPS providers, but some of the more commonly chosen companies and products are listed below.

The costs referenced in the table below are currently reflective of pricing relevant for an Oxen Service Node, and running a stagenet Session Node will likely be lower cost.

| Hosting Provider | Product Name      | Cost Per Month ($USD) |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Netcup           | VPS 1000 G8       | 10.50                 |
| Evolution Host   | STARTER           | 5.50                  |
| Online.net       | Start-2-S-SSD     | 13.99                 |
| Scaleway         | START1-M          | 9.33                  |
| OVH              | VPS SSD 2         | 7.61                  |
| Leaseweb         | Virtual Server XL | 34.45                 |
| Digital Ocean    | 4 GB, 2 vCPUs     | 24                    |
| Linode           | 4 GB, 2 vCPUs     | 20                    |
| Feral Hosting    | Neon Capability   | 19.68                 |
| Trabia           | VDS-8G            | 38.54                 |
| Hetzner          | EX41-SSD (30 TB)  | 39.71                 |

Note: Session does not endorse any of these providers. This list is merely a selection of some of the popular options at the time of writing. Of course, this popularity comes at the expense of decentralisation. A useful resource in choosing a less common VPS provider is [ExoticVM](https://www.exoticvm.com/). Another good one is [Server Hunter](https://www.serverhunter.com/).

In any case, do not just settle on the first provider you encounter. No two are alike. Do your own research and choose a provider that seems professional, reputable and fits your budget.

The better ones will utilise [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) [virtualisation technology](https://www.tradingfxvps.com/kvm-vs-vmware-vs-openvz-vs-xen/). In particular, you should steer clear of any VPS which uses OpenVZ. This is an incomplete form of virtualisation that allows VPS capacity to be oversold, and is usually incompatible with the full Session Node software. While it may function for the current stagenet, virtual machines created with it often lack a `/dev/tun` device, which effectively prevent it from providing the Lokinet service required for a mainnet Node.

A good VPS provider will also allow you to monitor your machine's resource consumption, seamlessly upgrade to a more powerful server at a later date, remotely reboot the host if it becomes unresponsive, and even recover or rebuild the system using out-of-band access if, for example, a bad configuration change results in lost network access.

When selecting your VPS‚Äô operating system, please choose the latest Ubuntu LTS release or latest Debian stable release (currently 24.04 and 12, respectively) if you want to be able to follow the steps below verbatim.&#x20;

### Step 2: Preparing your server

Every provider has a slightly different way of issuing you access to your new VPS. Most will send an email with the IP address, root username, and a root password to the VPS.

To access your server, you will need an SSH client for your operating system. Because this guide will use Windows to illustrate the setup process, we‚Äôll download [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/). macOS and Linux users can connect by opening a terminal and typing:

```
ssh root@[your VPS IP address]
```

To connect to your VPS, you'll need to paste the provided IP address into the SSH client‚Äôs ‚ÄúHost Name (or IP address)‚Äù input box and click the ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù button. The Port number can usually just be left as `22`.

A terminal window will now appear, prompting you for your log-in details, username (`root`) and password, as provided by your VPS provider. When entering your password, characters will not appear in the terminal. This is normal. Hit enter after typing or pasting your password, and you should be logged in to your VPS.

_Note: After logging in for the first time, the VPS may prompt you for a new password for the root account. The terminal will require you to enter the new password twice before you can start running commands. If you aren't prompted for a new root password but want to change it anyway, type sudo passwd. Choose something very secure!_

#### 2.1: Hot tips for using the console on Windows

Consoles don't quite work like the rest of your computer. Here are some basic tips for navigating your way around the command line!

* Don't try copying something by using the usual `Ctrl + C` hotkey! If you want to copy something, do so by highlighting text and then right clicking it and selecting Copy. Pasting works by right clicking a blank area in the console and selecting Paste.
* If you want to kill a process or stop something from running, press `Ctrl + C`. (This is why you shouldn't try copying something with this hotkey!)
* You can always check the directory you are in by typing `pwd`, and you can list its contents by typing `ls`.
* You can always return to your home directory by typing `cd` and pressing Enter.
* You can move into a given directory by typing `cd <name>` or move back up one level by typing `cd ..`.
* PuTTY allows you to easily duplicate or restart a session by right clicking the top of the window. Handy if you‚Äôre trying to do a few things at once.

#### 2.2: Server preparation continued

Next, update your package lists (the lists that tell your server which software is available for install or upgrade). The following command downloads package lists from their respective package repositories and "updates" them to get information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies. It will do this for all repositories and PPAs.

```
sudo apt update
```

You'll notice a bunch of package lists were downloaded. Once this is complete run the below command to fetch new versions of any packages that came preinstalled on the system.

```
sudo apt upgrade
```

You'll be prompted to authorise the use of disk space. Type `y` and Enter to authorise.

If you are prompted during the upgrade that a new version of any file is available then click the up and down arrows until you are hovering over `install the package maintainer‚Äôs version` and click Enter.

Alright, good to go. Our server is now set up, up to date, and is not running as root. On to the fun part!

#### 2.3: Firewall configuration

If you are using a firewall then ensure that the following ports are open/reachable

* Port 11022 (blockchain syncing)
* Port 11025 (stagenet Session Node to stagenet Session Node)

### Step 3: Initial repository setup

You only need to do this step the first time you want to set up the Oxen repository; when you've done it once, the repository will automatically update whenever you fetch new system updates.

To add the `apt` repository, run the following commands.

This first command installs the public key used to sign the stagenet Session Node packages:

```
sudo curl -so /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/oxen.gpg https://deb.oxen.io/pub.gpg
```

The second command tells `apt` where to find the packages.&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
echo "deb https://deb.oxen.io $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/oxen.list
```
{% endcode %}

If your distribution does not have `lsb_release` available, you may substitute `<DISTRO>` in the following command with the appropriate value to match your operating system. If your VPS is running Ubuntu 24.04 as recommended in this guide, replace `<DISTRO>` with `noble`.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
echo "deb https://deb.oxen.io <DISTRO> main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/oxen.list
```
{% endcode %}

Other supported distributions include:

* bookworm (Debian 12)
* bullseye (Debian 11)
* noble (Ubuntu 24.04)\
  jammy (Ubuntu 22.04)
* focal (Ubuntu 20.04)

There are also repositories for Debian testing (`trixie` or `testing`) and unstable (`sid` or `unstable`), and the latest or upcoming Ubuntu non-LTS release is typically supported. Note, however, that none of these distribution versions are recommended for production stagenet Session Nodes.

Then resync your package repositories with:

```
sudo apt update
```

### Step 4: Getting an Arbitrum Sepolia testnet RPC provider account

You will need to set up an Arbitrum Sepolia RPC provider for your stagenet-oxend to interact with the Arbitrum Sepolia network. This setup will allow your stagenet Session node to communicate with the Arbitrum Sepolia blockchain and to witness and facilitate transactions.&#x20;

You can use public RPC providers like Infura and Alchemy or set up your own Arbitrum Sepolia full node and connect to that node locally . Whilst Arbitrum has several RPC providers available, getting familiar with these providers will be useful for mainnet where a reliable RPC connection is required for the stability of your node. For testnet the free tier of public providers is currently sufficient to participate.

* Arbitrum‚Äôs recommendations: [https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/reference/node-providers#arbitrum-public-rpc-endpoints](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/reference/node-providers#arbitrum-public-rpc-endpoints)
* Infura: See [https://docs.infura.io/api/getting-started](https://docs.infura.io/api/getting-started) and get setup with a Arbitrum Sepolia node through Infura.
* Alchemy: See [https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/alchemy-quickstart-guide](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/alchemy-quickstart-guide) to get setup with an Arbitrum Sepolia node through Alchemy.

For example if you were using Alchemy as an RPC provider your URL would look something like:

```
https://arb-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/32bfi3gb298fbb32byfb32bf
```

_Note: The RPC URL here uses a mock API key_

Find your RPC URL and copy it for use in the next step.&#x20;

### Step 5: Stagenet Session Node installation and operation

To install the software needed to run a stagenet Session Node, simply install the `session-stagenet-node` package:

```
sudo apt install session-stagenet-node
```

This will detect your public IP (or allow you to enter it yourself), ask for your Arbitrum Sepolia testnet L2 provider URL, and create the `/etc/oxen/stagenet.conf` configuration file with the necessary additional settings to run a stagenet Session Node.

#### 5.1: Interacting with the running `oxend-stagenet`

So as to not interfere with current mainnet oxend nodes, the stagenet packaging installs its binary under the \`oxend-stagenet\` command.

If you run the `oxend-stagenet` command with an appended command (note that `sudo` is not required!), the `oxend-stagenet` command forwards this instruction to the running `oxend-stagenet`. So, for example, to get the current `oxend-stagenet` status you can run you would run:

```
oxend-stagenet status

oxend-stagenet print_sn_status
```

To see the output log of your node you can run the following command:

```
journalctl -u oxen-stagenet-node -f
```

This is useful to see if your node is syncing with the blockchain and to see other diagnostic messages that may come up from time to time. (Press `Ctrl-C` to stop watching the log).

For a full list of supported commands run:

```
oxend-stagenet help
```

You can also get basic statistics (such as uptime proof and ping times) on the running daemon from the `systemctl status` commands:

```
systemctl status oxen-stagenet-node
```

### Step 6: Stagenet Session Node Registration

#### 6.1: Retrieving your wallet address

You'll need your Ethereum wallet address to register your stagenet Session Node. Navigate to your Ethereum wallet and copy your wallet address.&#x20;

#### 6.2a: Individual Staking

To run a stagenet Session Node as the sole contributor, you'll need:

* A fully synchronized, up-to-date Oxen daemon running on your stagenet Session Node
* An Ethereum wallet with at least 20,000 test SESH in it (to meet the staking requirement to register your stagenet Session Node), and sufficient test ETH on the Arbitrum Sepolia network for gas.&#x20;

If you don't have test SESH, join the [Session Token Discord](https://discord.gg/sessiontoken) to request some via the [referral program](https://token.getsession.org/blog/testnet-referrals).

#### 6.2b: Multicontributor Staking

To run a stagenet multicontributor Session Node as the operator, you'll need:

* A fully synchronized, up-to-date Oxen daemon running on your stagenet Session Node
* An Ethereum wallet with at least 5,000 test SESH in it (to meet the operator staking requirement to register your stagenet Session Node), and sufficient test ETH on the Arbitrum Sepolia network for gas.&#x20;

#### 6.3: Preparing your node for registration

Log in (if not already logged in) to the VPS running the stagenet Session Node, then run the following command:

```
oxend-stagenet register [your ETH address]
```

The daemon will output something which looks similar to:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
Submitting operator-only information to stake.getsession.org, please wait.
 
Submitted operator-only information to the staking website successfully!

View your registration at: https://stake.getsession.org/register/[Session Node ID]
```
{% endcode %}

_NOTE: This information will be automatically submitted to the stagenet staking website to help with creating the transaction on the Sepolia testnet._&#x20;

#### 6.4a: Registering your single contributor Session Node

To register and stake your stagenet Session Node, ensure your Etherem wallet has a balance of at least 20,000 test SESH as well as sufficient test ETH for gas.

Navigate to the [Staking Portal](https://stake.getsession.org/) and connect your wallet. On the **Register** page, the node you have prepared registration for will appear in the 'Your Prepared Registrations' list.\
\
View the prepared node‚Äôs details and confirm your registration and stake of 20,000 test SESH.

#### 6.4a: Registering your multicontributor Session Node

To register and stake your stagenet Session Node, ensure your Ethereum wallet has a balance of at least 5,000 test SESH as well as sufficient test ETH for gas.

Navigate to the [Staking Portal](https://stake.getsession.org/) and connect your wallet. On the **Register** page, the node you have prepared registration for will appear in the 'Your Prepared Registrations' list.

When you view the prepared node's details you can customise your stake amount and operator fee. Change these to whatever you wish, keeping in mind that the minimum Stake Amount for the operator is 5,000 test SESH. Once you have confirmed these values, hit 'Create & Stake to Multicontributor Node'

You node will be listed on the [Staking Portal](https://stake.getsession.org/) as an Open Session Node, and anyone can stake to it from there. Once your node has reached full 20,000 test SESH stake amount, it will automatically be registered on the network.

### Step 7: Stagenet Session Node status check

After you've staked to your stagenet Session Node, you can check that stagenet Session Node is running, recognised, and eligible to earn test SESH rewards on the [My Stakes](https://stake.getsession.org/mystakes) page.

_Note: It can take a few minutes for your node to become fully registered and appear in the ‚ÄúMy Stakes‚Äù page after submitting the Aribtrum Sepolia transactions_

## Operating your node

### Keeping your binaries up to date

When a new release is available, upgrading is as simple as syncing with the repository:

```
sudo apt update
```

Then installing updates using:

```
sudo apt upgrade
```

_Note that this will install both updated_ `oxend-stagenet` _packages and any available system updates (this is generally a good thing!)_

During the upgrade, all instances of `oxend-stagenet` will be restarted if they are currently running in order to switch to the updated `oxend-stagenet`.&#x20;

If for some reason you want to install only Oxen package upgrades but not other system package updates, then instead of the `sudo apt upgrade` you can use:

```
sudo apt install session-stagenet-node
```

### Monitoring

Use the [My Stakes](https://stake.getsession.org/mystakes) page to monitor the status of your staked node.&#x20;

### Back-ups

You should immediately make a backup of your Stagenet Session Node's secret keys. This will allow you to migrate your node to a different hardware provider if necessary in the future.

<mark style="color:red;">**IMPORTANT: These keys should always remain secret and should never be shared with anyone. Sharing these keys can result in the loss of funds or deregistration of your node.**</mark>

The command to reveal the ed25519 secret keys is:

```
oxen-sn-keys-snapshot show /var/lib/oxen/stagenet/key_ed25519
```

The command to reveal your BLS secret keys is:

```
oxen-sn-keys-snapshot show /var/lib/oxen/stagenet/key_bls
```

Alternatively, you can use a tool like _scp_ to copy these files off-host for safekeeping.

### Restoration

If you backed up your keys and want to restore an unregistered node to use those backed up keys you can use the following commands.

The command to restore an ed25519 key into a file is:

```
oxen-sn-keys-snapshot restore /var/lib/oxen/stagenet/key_ed25519
```

The command to restore BLS key into a file is:&#x20;

```
oxen-sn-keys-snapshot restore-bls /var/lib/oxen/stagenet/key_bls
```

Those commands will create a new key file with the correct formatting called ‚Äúkey\_ed25519‚Äù and ‚Äúkey\_bls‚Äù respectively, if you want to overwrite an existing key file you can pass  the ‚Äú-- overwrite‚Äù flag as such:&#x20;

```
oxen-sn-keys-snapshot restore --overwrite /var/lib/oxen/stagenet/key_ed25519
```

For BLS keys:&#x20;

```
oxen-sn-keys-snapshot restore-bls --overwrite /var/lib/oxen/stagenet/key_bls
```

You can choose either to overwrite your existing key files in the /var/lib/oxen/stagenet directory using this command or create new key files and swap them out with the existing files, once keys are overwritten or swapped your node can be restarted with the following command:&#x20;

```
systemctl restart oxen-stagenet-node
```

<mark style="color:red;">IMPORTANT: Never remove or replace keys on an active, registered stagenet Session Node!</mark>

### Updating L2 Providers and additional node configuration

You can reconfigure your Session by modifying the file at `/etc/oxen/stagenet.conf` where settings are kept for the current running instance.&#x20;

In `/etc/oxen/stagenet.conf` each line denotes a configurable option. \
\
For example, in the following, the Session node is configured to use `http://example.com` as the primary L2 provider and `http://backup.example.com` as a backup if the first provider falls behind.

```
data-dir=/var/lib/oxen/stagenet
log-file=/var/log/oxen/stagenet.log
service-node=1
stagenet=1
service-node-public-ip=<your node's IP address>
l2-provider=http://example.com
l2-provider=http://backup.example.com
```

Some additional options are available for advanced users to configure how the Session node talks to the L2 provider:

* `l2-refresh` Specify the time (in seconds) between refreshes of the Ethereum L2 provider current state (default is 60)
* `l2-timeout` Specify the timeout (in seconds) for requests to the L2 provider current state; if multiple providers are configured then after a timeout the next provider will be tried (default is 5)
* `l2-max-logs` Specify the maximum number of logs we will request at once in a single request to the L2 provider. If more logs are needed than this at once then multiple requests will be used (default is 1000).
* `l2-check-interval` When multiple L2 providers are specified, this specifies how often (in seconds) all of them should be checked to see if they are synced and, if not, switch to a backup provider. Earlier L2 providers will be preferred when all providers are reasonably close (default is 170)
* `l2-check-threshold` When multiple L2 providers are specified, this is the threshold (in number of blocks) behind the best provider height before a given provider is considered out of sync (default is 120).

An exhaustive list of available options can be found by running `oxend-stagenet --help`.

After making your changes, you must restart your node for the new settings to apply. Use the following command:

```
systemctl restart oxen-stagenet-node
```

### Unlocking your stake

Stagenet Session Nodes will continually earn test SESH rewards indefinitely until an exit is requested or the node becomes deregistered. To request an exit to reclaim your test SESH stake, simply open the [Staking Portal](https://stake.getsession.org/) and navigate to the [My Stakes](https://stake.getsession.org/mystakes) page. You can then click Request Exit for any stake you wish to initiate an unlock for.

Your stagenet Session Node will become eligible to exit 1 day after the initial request (and after 15 days on mainnet).

When a stagenet Session Node has become eligible to exit (after 1 day has elapsed after an exit request), the node must formally exit the network within 2 hours of becoming eligible (or within 15 days after becoming eligible to exit on mainnet). Simply click the Exit button on the node in the Staking Portal. After exiting, you can claim your stake by clicking the Claim button on your My Stakes page.

If the node is not removed within 2 hours becoming eligible to exit (or 7 days after becoming eligible on mainnet, 22 days after the initial exit request), the node becomes eligible for liquidation by other users. When a node gets liquidated, a 0.2% penalty is taken from the operator's stake: 0.1% of the operator‚Äôs stake is transferred to the liquidator, and 0.1% of the operator‚Äôs stake is returned to the Staking Reward Pool.\


### Deregistrations

Deregistrations can be issued at any point during the active lifecycle of a stagenet Session Node, including during the period after requesting an exit.

Deregistration removes your stagenet Session Node from the network, and your stake(s) become locked and unspendable for 2 days (30 days on mainnet) from the block in which the stagenet Session Node was deregistered. After this period, operator and contributors can retrieve their stakes by clicking the Claim button in the Staking Portal.

Receiving a deregistration **after** the node's participant(s) have already submitted an exit request overrides the 1 day stake unlock time (15 days on mainnet), and sets the unlock time to 2 days (30 days on mainnet).

There are currently bugs affecting deregistrations, and development work is underway to optimise this process. Once finalized, this is how liquidations will work in the case of a deregistration:

To avoid losing 0.2% of their stake to the liquidation penalty, operators can manually exit their node by clicking the Exit button in the Staking Portal. The stake will still remain locked for 30 days. If the node has not been manually exited within 2 hours following deregistration (7 days on mainnet), it is eligible for liquidation.

Running a stagenet Session Node during will be more challenging than running an Oxen Service Node and deregistrations may be more likely. Please stay up to date with changes and ongoing development via [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Xj3HpbWxbA).

### Conclusion

Well done! Your stagenet Session Node is configured, operational, and will now begin receiving test SESH rewards.
