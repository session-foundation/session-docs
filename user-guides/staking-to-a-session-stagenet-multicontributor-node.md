# Staking to a Session Stagenet Multicontributor Node

### Staking to a Stagenet Session Node

Session Stagenet Nodes can be run by a single contributor, or by multiple contributors who pool their test SESH to meet the staking requirement of 20,000. This guide covers how to stake to a multi-contributor node which is awaiting contribution.&#x20;

If you wish instead to register a node, you can find out how to do that [here](session-stagenet-node-setup.md).

#### Step 1:

Navigate to the [Staking Portal](https://stake.getsession.org/) and connect your wallet.

#### Step 2:

Navigate to the [Stake Now](https://stake.getsession.org/stake) page to view the list of nodes awaiting contribution (Open Session Nodes)

The listed nodes will show the minimum and maximum contribution amounts, as well as the operator fee.&#x20;

#### Step 3:&#x20;

Once you have selected a node to stake to, hit **View** to examine the node details.

From this menu you can enter the amount of test SESH you wish to stake, and then hit the green button which reads 'Stake (Amount) SESH to Multicontributor Node'

#### Step 4:

Your stake will be contributed to the node and once the total amount staked has reached 20,000 it will be registered on the network and you will begin earning rewards.
