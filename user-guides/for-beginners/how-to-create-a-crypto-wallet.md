# üëõ How to create a crypto wallet

### What are crypto wallets?&#x20;

A crypto wallet is a tool that lets you store and manage your cryptocurrency, like Session Tokens. Just like a real wallet holds your cash, a crypto wallet holds your digital coins. It‚Äôs where you can send, receive, and store your tokens safely.

A wallet has two important parts:

**Public Key:** Think of this like your bank account number. You can share this with people so they can send you crypto.

**Private Key:** This is like your password. Only you should know this, as it controls access to your wallet.

Crypto wallets also come with a seed phrase, which is a series of words you can use to recover your wallet if you ever lose access to it‚Äîsimilar to your Recovery Password in Session.

### What is an Ethereum wallet?

An Ethereum wallet is a type of crypto wallet that works with the popular blockchain called Ethereum. Like many other cryptocurrency tokens, Session Token uses Ethereum. There are several different wallet providers, including MetaMask, Rabby, and Trust Wallet. This guide will illustrate the process with MetaMask, one of the most widely used crypto wallets. \

It‚Äôs important to note that transactions with Session Token using your Ethereum wallet, while anonymous, are **not private by default.**

### How do I create my crypto wallet?

Creating your wallet is easy with MetaMask, one of the most popular wallets. Here‚Äôs how to set it up:

1. **Install MetaMask.** Head to the MetaMask website and download the browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, or Brave.
2. **Set a Password.** Choose a strong password to protect your wallet.
3. **Create a Wallet.** After installing, click on the MetaMask icon in your browser. Select ‚ÄúCreate a Wallet‚Äù and follow the instructions.&#x20;
4. **Backup Your Seed Phrase.** MetaMask will give you a seed phrase (a series of words, just like your Session recovery password). Write it down and store it in a safe place. Remember, this phrase is the only way to recover your wallet if you lose access!&#x20;
5. After confirming your seed phrase, your wallet is **ready to use!**&#x20;

You now have a crypto wallet with a unique wallet address, a string of letters and numbers that looks something like this: 0x1A2b3C4d5E6f7G8h9I0jK1L2m3N4O5P6qR7s8T9

This is your public address, which you can share with others to receive tokens. Think of it as your crypto bank account number.

### How do I use my crypto wallet safely?

To keep your crypto safe, follow these important security tips:

1. **Keep Your Private Key and Seed Phrase Secure.** Never share your private key or recovery phrase with anyone. These give full access to your wallet.
2. **Use Strong Passwords.** Ensure that the password for your wallet is long and unique.
3. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).** If possible, enable 2FA using an authentication app or hardware keys on the services connected to your wallet.
4. **Be Careful with Phishing Scams.** Always double-check website URLs and avoid clicking on suspicious links to prevent phishing attacks that try to steal your credentials.\
