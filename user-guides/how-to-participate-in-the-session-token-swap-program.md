# ♻️ How to participate in the Session Token Swap Program

A total of 60,000,000 Session Tokens are reserved in the Session Token Swap Program through Oxen Coin Claims and Service Node Bonus, with each group receiving half of the amount.&#x20;

This represents 25% of the maximum supply of Session Token, and 75% of the circulating supply at TGE.

To participate in the Oxen Coin Claims, you must swap OXEN you hold after the Session Token generation event. To participate in the Service Node Bonus, you must stake OXEN you hold and [register using the online portal](https://swap.oxen.io/). **You can participate in both programs if you choose to both stake&#x20;**_**and**_**&#x20;swap OXEN you hold**.

If you do not hold OXEN, you can learn more via the [Oxen website](https://oxen.io).&#x20;
