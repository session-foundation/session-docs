# Session Network

The Session Network is a decentralized, open-source blockchain network that enables the transmission of encrypted data, specifically for Session messenger.

### Key elements of the Session Network <a href="#docs-internal-guid-0f67d5c5-7fff-50be-03e4-18f0349c4893" id="docs-internal-guid-0f67d5c5-7fff-50be-03e4-18f0349c4893"></a>

The Session Network is a decentralized physical infrastructure network with thousands of nodes and millions of users. Here are the key elements which enable the Session Network: \


* Decentralized: The Session Network is a peer-to-peer network, it is not controlled by any single entity, but by a distributed network of 2,000+ Session Nodes in over 50 countries
* Session Nodes: Nodes provide the basic infrastructure for a communication network: message sending, storage, and delivery
* Validator software: Validator software enables core functionality of peers in the network, including basic requirements such as message storage and onion-routing protocol(s), as well as more complex logic such as network storage layers
* Session Token: Session Token is the native cryptocurrency of the Session Network, used for staking, and paying for transactions and computational services, such as Session’s advanced features. Session Token will be issued on Ethereum, while the incentive layer (staking and rewards) is launching on Arbitrum One
* Proof of Stake: The Session Network uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, with users depositing Session Token stakes in order to register Session Nodes
* Session appchain: To scale with the demands of a modern messaging application and related infrastructure, certain tasks are offloaded to the Session appchain, a sidechain with low-fees
* Session Names: The Session Network maintains its own name service (Session Name Service) using a series of smart contracts; this allows users to buy and trade unique Session Names (e.g. for use in Session messenger)

### Session Network use cases

The Session Network is primarily utilized as infrastructure for Session messenger. However, there are many other future use cases for the Session Network. \


* Private messaging: Session is a decentralized, encrypted, and private messaging application. Free from ads and trackers, Session is already used actively by over 1,000,000 people
* Commercial messaging: Session Network and modified Session software can be used to quickly and efficiently deploy commercial messaging solutions
* Community hosting: The Session Network combined with Session Community Servers can be utilized to host large-size communities&#x20;
* In-app wallets: Combining Session’s messaging with in-built cryptocurrency wallets, the Session Network can be used to easily transact with your messaging contacts
* Session Names: The Session Name Service is an extensible naming system; the system can be used to easily find contacts on Session, create discoverable Communities, or connect to other content (e.g. web links)
* Private routing: The Session Network can be used in place of a VPN or other onion-router software, with advantages in speed and scalability. Achievable through integration of the novel [Lokinet](https://lokinet.org/) protocol\
