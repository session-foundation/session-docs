# Session Protocol

The Session Protocol is an encryption protocol specifically designed for deployment in decentralized networks, optimizing to achieve high levels of security and reliability without requiring strong guarantees of client synchronicity and permanent storage mediums.&#x20;

In the context of one-on-one messaging, the Session Protocol provides a simple stateless end-to-end encryption protocol, and in the context of groups, it provides a protocol that can scale and tolerate faults caused by the constraints of the Session Node network.

The Session Protocol is currently utilized by [Session messenger](../../).
