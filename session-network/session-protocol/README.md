# Session Protocol

{% hint style="info" %}
[**Session Protocol V2**](https://getsession.org/blog/session-protocol-v2) **is currently in development!** V2 plans to add support for post-quantum cryptography, re-implement Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), and bring more secure multi-device account management.

The Session Protocol is an encryption protocol specifically designed for deployment in decentralized networks, optimizing to achieve high levels of security and reliability without requiring strong guarantees of client synchronicity and permanent storage mediums.&#x20;

In the context of one-on-one messaging, the Session Protocol provides a simple stateless end-to-end encryption protocol, and in the context of groups, it provides a protocol that can scale and tolerate faults caused by the constraints of the Session Node network.

The Session Protocol is currently utilized by [Session messenger](../../).
