# Account restoration

Because Session does not have a central server to keep records of users’ accounts, the commonly expected user experience of account recovery using a username and password is not possible.

Instead, users are prompted to write down their long-term private key upon account generation. This long-term private key is represented as a mnemonic seed phrase, referred to within Session as a Recovery Password.

A user may use their Recovery Password to recover their account if their device is lost or destroyed. This enables the user’s contacts to keep communicating with the same Account ID, instead of needing to establish contact with a new Account ID.

Never share your Recover Password with anyone. Make sure to store it in a safe and secure place.
