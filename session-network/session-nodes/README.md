# Session Nodes

Session Nodes are incentivized full nodes which secures and enables the functionality of the Session Network. Nodes are responsible for validating transactions and data (such as messages) for the Session Network.

A full Session Node requires a stake of Session Tokens and a minimum level of computational resources (bandwidth, storage, and processing time) to meet its validation responsibilities. This validation provides security and function to the Session Network. In return, Session Nodes receive Session Token rewards from the Staking Reward Pool.
