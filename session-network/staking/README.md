# Staking

Staking allows users to earn rewards for securing the Session Network. It is simple and fast to begin staking and join Session’s network of over 2,000 nodes.

Regardless of how many Session Tokens you have, you can contribute to the network’s security and receive rewards.

### Instant rewards

As soon as you start staking and join the network, you begin earning rewards. Your rewards can be claimed whenever it is convenient for you.&#x20;

### Staking Portal

The Staking Portal provides a simple, easy-to-use web interface for you to manage your stakes and rewards. All you need is a wallet (such as MetaMask) and a browser. Using the Session Staking Portal, you can generally stake within minutes.

### Scaling rewards

Rewards for stakers scale based on the amount of tokens in the Staking Reward Pool. A targeted rate of 14% of the total reward pool is awarded to the network each year, calculated daily. As the amount of Session Tokens in the Staking Reward Pool increases, Session Token Rewards also increase (and vice versa).&#x20;
