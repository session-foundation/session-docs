# Service Node Bonus Program

The Service Node Bonus Program is rewarding existing Oxen Service Node operators and contributors for their contribution to the network and incentivizing the transition of the Oxen Service Node network to the new Session Network.

**30,000,000 Session Tokens** will be awarded to participating Oxen Service Nodes upon Session Tokenâ€™s Token Generation Event (TGE). The Session Tokens available in this program represents 37.5% of the Genesis supply. You can read more about the genesis tokenomics[ here](https://docs.getsession.org/tokenomics/genesis-tokenomics).

Along with the parallel Oxen Coin Claims Program (30,000,000 SESH allocated), these programs represent 75% of the maximum Genesis supply and 25% of the maximum supply of Session Token.

To ensure dedicated community members who have been staking long-term are sufficiently rewarded, snapshots have been captured since the 25th of September 2023. From this point onward, Oxen Service Node operators and contributors can start earning Staking Points.

Staking Points are accrued relative to the amount of OXEN staked. Program participants will receive part of the 30,000,000 Session Tokens proportional to their Staking Points.

Participation in the Service Node Bonus Program is now closed. You can check still your points via the leaderboard on the[ portal](https://swap.oxen.io/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: You can participate in both the Service Node Bonus Program _**and**_ the Oxen Coin Claims Program if you choose to stake and swap OXEN you hold. Read more about the Oxen Coin Claims Program [here](oxen-coin-claims.md).&#x20;
