# Testnet Incentive Program

The Testnet Incentive Program is currently running to ensure a successful migration to the new Session Network.

Session messenger is a live product with a high number of users, and this testnet phase is vital in identifying and eliminating any issues prior to the network transition. This program is designed to reward active community participation as they battle-test the new Session network ahead of its mainnet launch.
