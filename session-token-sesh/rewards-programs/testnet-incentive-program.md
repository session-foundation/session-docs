# Testnet Incentive Program

The Testnet Incentive Program ran from July 2024-May 2025 to help ensure a successful migration to the new Session Network.

Session messenger is a live product with a high number of users, and this testnet phase is vital in identifying and eliminating any issues prior to the network transition. This program was designed to reward active community participation as they battle-test the new Session network ahead of its mainnet launch.\

1M Session Tokens were allocated as rewards to the Testnet Incentive Program.&#x20;
