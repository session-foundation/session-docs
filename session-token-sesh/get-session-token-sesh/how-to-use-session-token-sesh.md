# How to use Session Token (SESH)

Session Token has multiple uses, including staking and accessing advanced features in Session.

#### Staking

Earn rewards while securing Session by staking your Session Tokens. Staking is fast and simple—all you need is a wallet and some Session Tokens.&#x20;

Every node in the Session Network requires a stake of Session Tokens to activate. Although the full stake amount is fixed, you do not need to deposit a full stake yourself. You can simply delegate your Session Tokens to a single stake—no matter how many tokens you have.

Once the full stake is deposited, the node runs its validator software and registers on the network. Nodes are responsible for storing and validating data and transactions for the Session Network. This keeps Session secure for everyone, with stakers being rewarded with Session Tokens.

#### Advanced features

Session Token can be used to access advanced features in Session, such as Session Names and Session Pro.&#x20;

These features require special validation and processing from the Session Network. To account for this additional work, Session Network Fees must be paid (in Session Token) to access these features.&#x20;
