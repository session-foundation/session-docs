# How to view SESH in your Wallet

When you receive test SESH tokens, you may notice they don’t automatically appear in your Ethereum wallet. This is because wallets don’t automatically display all tokens—they only show tokens you’ve specifically added. To view your test SESH tokens, you’ll need to manually import the token by adding its contract address to your wallet.

### What does it mean to import a contract address?

A contract address is a unique identifier for a token on the Ethereum blockchain. It points to the smart contract governing the token's operations—such as transfers, balances, and other functions. When you import a contract address into your wallet, you’re essentially telling the wallet to look for a specific token on the blockchain and display it in your interface. Without this step, your wallet holds the tokens, but it doesn’t know that it should display them.

Here are links to step-by-step guides to help you add test SESH to the most popular wallets.

You will be prompted to enter the below details:\
**Token Contract Address:** 0x7D7fD4E91834A96cD9Fb2369E7f4EB72383bbdEd\
**Token Symbol:** SESH\
**Token Decimal:** 9

You should also make sure you’re on the correct chain before you get started. For testnet, this is Arbitrum Sepolia.&#x20;

### Why don’t tokens show up automatically in my wallet?&#x20;

Ethereum wallets are designed to prioritize simplicity and security. They only display tokens you explicitly add. This ensures that your interface isn’t cluttered with irrelevant or scam tokens and allows you to control which assets appear in your wallet. Adding a token using its contract address is a standard way to make any Ethereum token visible in your wallet.
