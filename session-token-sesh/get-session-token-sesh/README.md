# Get Session Token (SESH)

Session Token has not yet been generated, and therefore cannot be purchased directly on open markets.&#x20;

However, there are a few ways that you can guarantee access to Session Token prior to the Token Generation Event (TGE):

### Rewards Programs

You can gain access to Session Token prior to the Token Generation Event (TGE) by staking Oxen coins to a registered Oxen Service Node to be automatically swapped for Session Tokens at TGE; or by holding Oxen coins and burning them in exchange for Session Tokens after TGE in the Oxen Coin Claims program.
