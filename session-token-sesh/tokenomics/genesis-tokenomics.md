Additional Session Tokens will enter circulation over time as their lockup periods expire. However, Session Tokens will be locked in the [Staking Reward Pool ](../../session-network/staking/staking-reward-pool.md)via mechanisms such as [Session Pro](../../session-messenger/advanced-features/session-pro.md) and removed from circulation via [staking](../../session-network/session-nodes/staking-and-collateralization.md), making it is difficult to predict the future values for circulating supply.
