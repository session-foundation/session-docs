Although Session Token has a maximum supply of 240,000,000, a **maximum of&#x20;**<mark style="background-color:green;">**80 million**</mark>**&#x20;Session Tokens are unlocked at TGE.**

* 6 million for Project Treasury (7.5% TGE supply)
* 14 million for the Ecosystem and Community Fund (17.5% TGE supply)
* 60 million from [Session Token Swap Program ](https://token.getsession.org/blog/session-token-swap-program)(75% TGE supply)

***

The remaining 160,000,000 are subject to varying lockup conditions. The following lockup conditions may apply:

<details>

<summary>Lockup A: Staked</summary>

Tokens are time-locked using a smart contract for 24 months following TGE. Tokens in this smart contract can be staked for participation in the Session Node Network. Rewards earnt through active staking are, as per usual, immediately accessible.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Lockup B: Linear</summary>

Tokens are time-locked using a smart contract for 24 months following TGE. Tokens in this smart contract cannot be staked. 12 months following TGE, a 12 month linear unlock begins at a rate of 8.33% claimable per month.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Lockup C: Unlocked</summary>

Tokens are distributed at TGE with no associated lockups or restrictions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Lockup D: Long term commit</summary>

Tokens are time-locked using a smart contract for 3 years following TGE. Tokens in this smart contract cannot be staked. 12 months following TGE, a 24 month linear unlock begins (at a rate of 4.16% claimable per month). When these tokens are allocated to any team member, there are performance and operational requirements which must be met before tokens are received.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Lockup E: Staking Reward Pool</summary>

Tokens are locked in a smart contract and released at a rate of 14% per year (recalculated per block). The rate of 14% is calculated relative to the total amount of Session Tokens in the Staking Reward Pool, and new Session Tokens may be added to the pool.

</details>

Additional Session Tokens will enter circulation over time as their lockup periods expire. However, Session Tokens will be locked in the [Staking Reward Pool ](../../session-network/staking/staking-reward-pool.md)via mechanisms such as [Session Pro](../../session-messenger/advanced-features/session-pro.md) and removed from circulation via [staking](../../session-network/session-nodes/staking-and-collateralization.md), making it is difficult to predict the future values for circulating supply.

Below is a graph which shows the supply over 5 years _without_ considering tokens locked in the Staking Reward Pool and via staking.&#x20;
