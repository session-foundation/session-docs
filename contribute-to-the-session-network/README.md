# Contribute to the Session Network

The best way to participate in the Session Network is by operating or contributing to a Session Node. Nodes are responsible for securing and validating transactions and data (such as messages) for the Session Network. By operating or contributing to a Session Node, you contribute to essential infrastructure for the Session ecosystem—and help protect the security and privacy of the people using Session.

All Session Nodes are required to deposit (or ‘stake') a fixed amount of Session Tokens and run validator software to register on the network.

### Single contributor nodes <a href="#docs-internal-guid-d0b9f261-7fff-16bc-d4c7-767475d8228a" id="docs-internal-guid-d0b9f261-7fff-16bc-d4c7-767475d8228a"></a>

Session Node operators manage the server (such as a VPS or home server) which runs the Session Node validator software. To run the software, the node will need to meet minimum hardware requirements. In a single contributor node, the node operator deposits the full stake required to register on the network.

Stakes can be deposited and managed using the [Staking Portal](https://stake.getsession.org/stake).

### Multicontributor nodes

If an operator does not have enough Session Tokens for a full stake (or does not wish to provide a full stake for some other reason), they can operate a multicontributor node. Multicontributor nodes allows for multiple to delegate their stake to a single node.&#x20;

Stakes are still managed by the staking smart contract, and funds are not held by the operator.&#x20;

Operators can set an operator fee on their multicontributor nodes, which is collected in SESH. This helps to cover operating costs of running a node. For example, if the operator sets a 10% operator fee, they will earn 10% of the SESH that would have been distributed to contributors. This mirrors how node operator fees will work on mainnet.
