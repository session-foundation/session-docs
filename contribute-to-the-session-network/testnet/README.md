# Testnet

The Session [Testnet Incentive Program](https://token.getsession.org/testnet-incentive-program) ran from July 16, 2024 to May 9, 2025. While the Incentive Program is now closed, testnet will continue to be available for user testing following Session Token's TGE. \
\
To get started with testnet, drop a message into the <mark style="background-color:green;">**#testnet**</mark> channel in the [Session Token Discord](https://discord.gg/sessiontoken) expressing your interest in receiving tSESH (test Session Tokens). You will also need ETH on the Arbitrum Sepolia Test Network for gas on testnet, which is freely available from some [faucets](https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia). \
\
Once you have test SESH, you can set up your own node following this [guide](session-stagenet-node-setup/). It is also technically possible to stake to existing [multicontributor nodes](staking-to-a-session-stagenet-multicontributor-node.md) on testnet, though depending on testing activity levels, there may not be many available at a given time.&#x20;
