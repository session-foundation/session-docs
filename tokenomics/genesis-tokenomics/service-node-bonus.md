# Service Node Bonus

The Service Node Bonus Program is rewarding existing Oxen Service Node operators and contributors for their contribution to the network and incentivising the transition of the Oxen Service Node network to the new Session Network.

30,000,000 Session Tokens will be awarded to participating Oxen Service Nodes upon Session Tokenâ€™s Token Generation Event (TGE).

To ensure dedicated community members who have been staking long-term are sufficiently rewarded, snapshots have been captured since the 25th of September 2023. From this point onward, Oxen Service Node operators and contributors can start earning Staking Points.

Staking Points are accrued relative to the amount of OXEN staked. Program participants will receive part of the 30,000,000 Session Tokens proportional to their Staking Points.

Participate in the Service Node Bonus using the [portal](https://swap.oxen.io/).&#x20;
