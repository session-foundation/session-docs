# ‚≠ê Getting started with Session Token

Session Token is an EVM-compatible token which can be used to unlock premium features in the Session application (Session Pro, Session Name Service) and as a security and incentivisation layer for Session Nodes.

### What can I do with Session Token?&#x20;

Session Tokens can be used to **subscribe** to Session Pro, to **register and trade** unique nicknames using the Session Name Service (SNS), and to **stake** and run a Session Node to help secure the Session Network.&#x20;

[session-token-utility](../session-token-utility/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### What's the supply? &#x20;

There is a maximum supply of **240,000,000 Session Tokens** although the circulating supply is **significantly lower** (80,000,000 at TGE).

{% hint style="info" %}
TGE stands for token generation event. This refers to the time a token is actually created. _Session Token_ is currently pre-TGE, so the actual token has not been generated.
{% endhint %}

Session Tokens spent on in-app services are **locked** in the [**Reward Pool**](../staking-reward-pool.md), lowering the circulating supply.

### Where can I buy Session Token?

Session Token hasn't been generated, so it is not available for direct purchase.

Currently, the only way to guarantee access to Session Token is through the [Session Token Swap Program](https://token.getsession.org/blog/session-token-swap-program). The cryptocurrency OXEN is required to participate in the swap program. Additionally, a larger amount of Session Token can be earnt if the OXEN is staked during the program.

Read more about the program [**here**](https://token.getsession.org/blog/session-token-swap-program).

### How do I stay up to date with Session Token?

Regular updates about the progress of Session Token and other parts of the project are shared on [X / Twitter](https://twitter.com/session_token), in the [Session Token Discord](https://discord.gg/pVYQvcSVrW), and on the Session app.
