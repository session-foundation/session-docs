# üåê Session Nodes

Session Network's functionality and scalability is enabled by a set of incentivised nodes called Session Nodes. Session Nodes are responsible for storing Session messages, routing Session messages, securing and governing the network, and maintaining the workchain.&#x20;

A full Session Node requires a stake of Session Tokens and a minimum level of computational resources (bandwidth, storage, and processing time) to the network. These resources are used to enable the function and network security of Session. In return for their services, Session Nodes receive rewards from the [Staking Reward Pool](../staking-reward-pool.md).

If an individual does not have sufficient Session Tokens for a full stake, multiple wallets (or people) can combine stakes to create a full stake.

The amount of Session Tokens required to stake will be announced closer to TGE.

In order to ensure sufficient Session Tokens to be able to re-stake after the Token Migration, current Oxen Service Node Operators should register for the Service Node Bonus Program as early as possible. [Learn more and register here.](https://swap.oxen.io/)

Currently, Session uses the Oxen Service Node Network for this infrastructure, with approximately 2,000 active nodes. It is anticipated the majority of these nodes will transition to the Session Network.
