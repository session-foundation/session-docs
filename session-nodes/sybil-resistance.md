# Sybil resistance

The cryptoeconomic structure of Session Token caters for market-based Sybil resistance for the Session Network; these Sybil resistant qualities are inherited by Session and other applications on the network.

This resistance is key to the networkâ€™s ability to preserve the privacy of both Session users and other network users: As an attacker would accumulate Session Tokens, the circulating supply would decrease, applying demand-side pressure and increasing the cost of purchasing further tokens.&#x20;

Two reciprocal mechanisms further frustrate the ability of a single-actors from acquiring a large enough quantity of Session Token to attack the network: time-locked collateralisation of Session Nodes, and the time-locked Token Reward Pool.

In the case an attacker was able to acquire a large enough amount of Session Tokens to perform the attack, the attack itself would depress demand for the Session Tokens purchased to perform the attack, and thus the attacker would be unable to recover their acquisition costs by reselling the tokens, making such an attack prohibitively expensive.
