# Session messenger

Session is a cross-platform, end-to-end encrypted messaging app designed to provide secure, private, and anonymous communication.

Session emphasizes user confidentiality and safety by eliminating the need for personal information during account creation and minimizing metadata during app usage.

Built on the web3-powered Session Network, Sessionâ€™s protocol offers advanced privacy features, such as onion-routing by default (protecting IP information), randomized alphanumeric IDs (instead of insecure phone numbers), and decentralized message storage (hardening against data leaks and censorship).

In addition to providing privacy and security, Session is also designed to be a full-featured modern messaging app:

* Cross platform support (_Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux_)
* Localization support in over 70 languages and dialects&#x20;
* User configurable privacy settings, such as disappearing messages and read receipts;
* User-first, joy-sparking features, such as emoji reactions
* P2P voice and video call
  * **SOON**: onion-routed voice and video calls using the novel Lokinet protocol
* Support for end-to-end encrypted file attachments, including videos, pdfs, and voice recordings
* Truly decentralized offline message delivery using swarms in the Session Network
* Self-managed keys (generated and stored on-device only), eliminating the trust-on-first-use dilemma

Session is the result of years of open-source development and the dedication of a diverse community of contributors and node operators.
