# ðŸ‘‹ Intro to Session Token

<mark style="background-color:green;">**Session Token staking and rewards contracts will be deployed on Arbitrum One.**</mark>

Session is an end-to-end encrypted, decentralised messaging application with **over 1,000,000 active users**. It's a messaging app like no other â€” with no phone number required on sign-up, onion-routed messaging, and decentralised server structure.&#x20;

Session has leveraged web3 to innovate in the growing privacy-tech industry â€” which is projected to grow into a [30 billion dollar industry by 2030](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/data-privacy-software-market-105420). Now, it is fast becoming a leading web3 consumer app.

All this is possible because of **Session Token**, the network's native cryptocurrency.

Session Token is used to subscribe to Session Pro, make registrations using the Session Name Service and staked to run Session Nodes.
