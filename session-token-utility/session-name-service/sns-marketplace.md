# SNS marketplace

Secondary marketplaces can be created for buying and selling registered SNS records. These marketplaces may be similar to NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea or Rarible.&#x20;

If other collectibles are created within the Session ecosystem, they may also be tradable on these marketplaces.

### Marketplace fees&#x20;

In order to ensure transfers of SNS records return value to the network, some fees in Session Token will be required to transfer ownership of an SNS record to another wallet. These marketplace fees will be represented as a percentage of the total transfer price.&#x20;

Marketplaces are in the planning stage. More information will be released at a later date.&#x20;
