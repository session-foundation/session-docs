# 🔁 Session Token Utility

Session Token can be used to unlock, access, or interact with certain services offered by Session.&#x20;

These services include in-app subscriptions (such as [Session Pro](session-pro.md)), registrations using the [Session Name Service](session-name-service/), and in the future may also include more utility such as one-time in-app purchases.&#x20;

When Session Token is used for these purposes, 90% of net tokens are locked in the [Staking Reward Pool](../staking-reward-pool.md), and 10% of net tokens are committed to protocol-owned liquidity.&#x20;
