# Communities

Communities are large-scale chats that can host hundreds or thousands of users at a time. Each community runs on an individual community-operated server, called a Session Open Group Server (SOGS).&#x20;

By storing messages on specialized SOGS (instead of on the Session Network), Communities are able to efficiently process chats with very large numbers of participants.&#x20;

Communities are commonly used to host conversations relating to specific interests or theme.

Although anyone can download and run the SOGS software, some technical expertise and resources are required to run your own server and set-up your own Community.
