# Advanced Features

The Session ecosystemâ€™s advanced features give users access to new and powerful functions. Activating or accessing these features may require the use of Session Token (such as for the Session Name Service), or technical understanding of how to operate a server (to set up a Community).

Read more about these planned and implemented advanced features in the pages under this section.
